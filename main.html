Product data includes categories like skis, bikes, or climbing gear, with attributes such as size, color, price, and stock levels. Customer data includes personal details, purchase history, and preferences. Sales data tracks transactions, discounts, and seasonal trends. Inventory management monitors product stock, warehouse locations, and reorder levels. Supplier data tracks vendor relationships, lead times, and pricing. This structure helps optimize operations, improve customer experience, and drive targeted marketing efforts. Data integration across departments ensures smooth business processes.
